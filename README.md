# Heart_Disease_Classification
The model is built using basic Python machine learning libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.

This model is not my original creation; it has been inspired by the model built by Daniel Bourke for the Kaggle online competition.

I created this model to gain a better understanding of how an actual professional model is developed and the steps involved in the process.
